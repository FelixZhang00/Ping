Unsure why you can't access a website? Ping! is a sleek, lightweight app that checks if a website is actually down or if your connection is the problem.

MONITORS:
Create monitors to watch the status of your favourite websites and notify you if they go down or come back up. Set up expiration dates so they stop running automatically when you no longer need them. Simply set them and forget - Ping! will intelligently let you know if their status changes.

MATERIAL DESIGN:
Ping! was written to take full advantage of the visual elements provided in Android 5.0 Lollipop with material design. Plenty of ripple effects, elevated views, bright colours, and elegant icons are present.

EFFICIENCY:
Designed from the bottom up with efficiency in mind, Ping! intelligently schedules its network activity and processes together with the rest of your device to use minimal battery life.
