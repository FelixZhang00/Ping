Set up expiration dates so they stop running automatically when you no longer need them. Simply set them and forget - Ping! will intelligently let you know if their status changes.\r\n\r\n![Monitor creation page](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xrfci6hu8d6ta80/device-2015-02-09-225242.png?dl=0)\r\n\r\n### MATERIAL DESIGN\r\nPing! was written to take full advantage of the visual elements provided in Android 5.0 Lollipop with material design.
